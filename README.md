## Introduction

The Applied Data Capstone project aims to solve a real-world problem using data science methodologies. In this project, we analyze data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), apply machine learning models, and derive insights to address the problem statement.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **Notebooks**: Contains Jupyter notebooks with detailed analysis and modeling steps.
- **Data**: Contains datasets used for analysis (note: data files are not included in the repository and need to be downloaded separately).
- **Scripts**: Contains Python scripts for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Reports**: Contains project reports and presentations.

## Installation

To run the notebooks and scripts in this project, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the necessary libraries. Follow the steps below to set up your environment:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Meshack132/Applied-Data-Capstone_X.git
   cd Applied-Data-Capstone_X
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage

Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `Notebooks` directory to follow the analysis and modeling steps. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the results. Additionally, you can use the scripts in the `Scripts` directory for specific tasks such as data processing or model training.
